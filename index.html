        <h3><u>Project details</u></h3>
        <p>My goal for this project was to look for a correlation between President Trump's approval rating and his
            Twitter activity (tweets and retweets) since Twitter seems to be his main source of communication with the
            general public. If there is no correlation between his approval rating and Twitter activity, how much of an
            impact does COVID-19, or economic factors affect his approval rating?</p>
        <p>To explore economic factors, I recorded daily closing prices for stock market inidices (NASDAQ, DJI, and
            S&P), number of unemployment claims submitted every week at a national level, and average weekly national
            gas prices (regular and diesel). I also recorded daily new and confirmed COVID cases at a national level
            since we are currently living in a pandemic. In order to try to measure the full impact of how COVID-19
            might be affecting Trump's approval rating, I collected all of my data starting from Jan 1st-Dec 7th, 2020.
        </p>
        <p><b>Hypothesis:</b> Due to Trump's unconventional presidency, I predicted that his Twitter activity would
            affect his approval rating more than economic factors or new and confirmed COVID cases at a national level.
        </p>
        <p><b>Conclusion:</b> Based on my <a href="data.json" target="_blank">data</a>, scatterplot explorations, and final visualization, I do not see a correlation
            between Trump's Twitter activity and his approval rating. Out of all my recorded properties, the one that
            seems to have the strongest correlation with his approval rating appears to be the number of new and
            confirmed COVID cases at a national level. This is not to say that COVID cases affect Trumpâ€™s approval
            rating consistently, but that it may have had an impact on his approval ratings between May-October 2020.
